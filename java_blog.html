                <h3>Java is easy to learn</h3>
                <p>Every programming language comes with a learning curve, but Java shares many similarities with C, C++
                    and JavaScript. Anyone with experience in any of those languages will pick up Java syntax quickly.
                </p>
                <p>Java also has a very rigid and predictable set of rules that govern code structure. This contrasts
                    starkly with other, untyped scripting languages where it seems like anything goes. When you try to
                    master a new programming language, a clear set of consistently enforced rules makes learning easier.

                <h3>The rich set of Java APIs</h3>
                <p>The Java API is extensive. The standard JDK comes with over 200 built-in packages containing Java
                    APIs that allow for everything from parsing XML to translating between time zones. When developers
                    add on the Jakarta EE APIs, they have an even more extensive library of APIs that allow for the
                    development of complex, middle-tier applications and cloud-native microservices.</p>
                <p>But the rich ecosystem of Java APIs extends far beyond those sanctioned by Oracle or provisioned
                    through Jakarta.</p>

                <h3>Java's tool ecosystem</h3>
                <p>The application development landscape is filled with software development tools written in Java -- by
                    Java developers -- that are designed to simplify and streamline the development, deployment and even
                    decommissioning of Java applications. A few examples of tools written in Java include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gradle: an incredibly powerful, open source build tool</li>
                    <li>Maven: an open source tool designed to solve dependency management problems</li>
                    <li>Jenkins: a Java-based continuous integration and delivery tool</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>First-order Android Support</h3>
                <p>Android is the world's most popular mobile phone OS and Java is the de facto programming language for
                    Android application development.</p>
                <p>While Android's version of Java isn't exactly the same as what you'd find on the JDK, Google did copy
                    over 11,500 lines of code from the Java Standard Edition when they built their Java clone. As a
                    result, developers can expect that the version of Java they see on Android is pretty close to the
                    original.</p>

                <h3>Forward evolution with backwards compatibility</h3>
                <p>Java evolves slowly, but it does evolve. With over 25 years of evolution, Java has plenty of
                    evolutionary improvements to be proud about.</p>
                <p>From the bulletproof modularity system that was delivered as part of Project Jigsaw, to the recently
                    added ability of functional programming in Java with lambda functions, Java continues to implement
                    big changes that the community demands. Incremental additions in non-LTS releases, such as the the
                    addition of the new Record data typeand garbage collectors for improved memory management, showcase
                    that the JDK is also constantly evolving.</p>
                <p>I personally compiled and packaged some complicated code that was written 20 years ago, and it ran
                    without any issues on the latest Java 17 release. When enterprise clients know that things won't
                    break when they perform a JVM upgrade, it gives just another reason why they choose to stick with
                    Java as the best programming language.</p>
